#summary Describe how to setup and run the source code

= Introduction =

This is source code for the ACCV 2007 paper, "Object Detection Combining Recognition and Segmentation"


= How to run the code =

== 1. Obtain the source code ==

You can obtain source code via subversion or directly go to Downloads page and download the zip file.

Let's denote the root folder of our source code as $SOURCE_CODE$.


== 2. Download image data and pb edge detector ==
Our test images can be download from here: [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/]

One of our edge detection relies on pb edge detector. Each download it from our Downloads page or from here: [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/]

Unzip image files to $SOURCE_CODE$/data/images/.

Unzip segbench.tar.gz to $SOURCE_CODE$/.

== 3. Add to Matlab path list ==

The 'startup.m' script is meant to add whole source directories (including sub-directories) to Matlab path list.

On Linux, if you start Matlab after you change working directory to $SOURCE_CODE$, the 'startup.m' script will be automatically invoked. Otherwise, run 'startup.m' when current directory points to $SOURCE_CODE$ in Matlab.

On Windows, 'startup.m' needs to be manually invoked.


== 4. Run demos ==

demo_train.m

demo_one_image.m

demo_multi_image.m
